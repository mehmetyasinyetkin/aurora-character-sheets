			<p>“This large sheepdog has luxuriant white-gold fur. A pair of broad wings stretches out from the creature's back, and its eyes are filled with an intelligent, silvery gleam.”</p>
			<p class="indent"> <strong>Celestial Guard Dogs.</strong> Created from the souls of exceptionally faithful guards and retainers who selflessly sacrificed themselves to protect others, chamrosh are celestials that take the form of large sheepdogs with silver-gold fur and eagle-like wings. They are known for their ability to sniff out evil and for their steadfast nature, refusing to back down from a fight even in the face of overwhelming odds. Because of this quality, chamrosh are often used as guard beasts by other celestials, though they are never treated as simple pets by even the haughtiest of angels.</p>
			<p class="indent"> <strong>Roaming Defenders.</strong>  When not employed by more powerful celestials as companions and guards, chamrosh gather in small packs to roam the planes of good, attacking any fiend or evil monster they come across. They also rescue lost or trapped mortals of good or neutral alignment, leading the mortals to a place of safety or to the nearest portal back to the Material Plane. Despite their appearance, chamrosh can speak and readily do so with mortals they rescue or celestials they serve or protect...</p>
			<p class="indent">  <strong>Occasional Planar Travelers.</strong> Chamrosh rarely travel to the Material Plane, but when they do, it is usually for an important mission, such as to defend a holy relic or to aid a paladin on a divine quest. Since a chamrosh cannot change its form, such missions do not generally involve infiltration or deception, and when the task is finished, the chamrosh is quick to return to its normal duties.</p>

			<p>Vega lets out a high-pitched bark at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target is of evil alignment, it must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't frightened. The bark has no effect on neutral or good-aligned creatures.</p>

			<p> Lost treasure and valuable relics brought you to Drakkenheim. Perhaps the prospect of earning more gold than you can spend in your lifetime is too tantalizing to pass up, or alternatively you may seek items for their historical or religious significance.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>  Investigation and one choice from the following: Stealth, Insight, or Perception</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Choose two, one of which must be Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>Thieves' tools, a set of dark clothes with a hood and a face covering. A signet ring of a fake lord, a fake identification, a set of weighted dice, and a deck of cards</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Treasure Hunter Secrets</h5>
			<p>Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy.
